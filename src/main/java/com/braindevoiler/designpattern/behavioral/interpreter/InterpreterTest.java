     * Use the Interpreter Pattern to build an interpreter for a language.
     * <p>
     * When you need to implement a simple language, the Interpreter Pattern defines a class-based representation for
     * its grammar along with an interpreter to interpret its sentences. To represent the language, you use a class
     * to represent each rule in the language.
     * <p>
     * Representing each grammar rule in a class makes the language easy to implement.
     * <p>
     * Because the grammar is represented by classes, you can easily change or extend the language.
     * <p>
     * Appropriate when you have a simple grammar and simplicity is more important than efficiency.
